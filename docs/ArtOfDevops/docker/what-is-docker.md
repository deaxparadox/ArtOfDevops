# What is docker?

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code and runtime. 

### Container

A container is runtime environment (basically a OS image), which have prebuilt environment for your application. Depending the application you are build (for example if you are building a Django application, you will pull a Python image file, which will already have a Python version installed in it, because Django is built on python), you will pull the required image, and setup your applicatin in it using the docker compose file.
